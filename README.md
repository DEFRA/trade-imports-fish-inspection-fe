## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd trade-imports-fish-importer-fe
nvm use
```

## Server-side Caching

We use Catbox for server-side caching. By default the service will use CatboxRedis when deployed and CatboxMemory for
local development.
You can override the default behaviour by setting the `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE` environment variable to either `redis` or
`memory`.

Please note: CatboxMemory (`memory`) is _not_ suitable for production use! The cache will not be shared between each
instance of the service and it will not persist between restarts.

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory key-value store. Every instance of a service has access to the same Redis key-value store similar
to how services might have a database (or MongoDB). All frontend services are given access to a namespaced prefixed that
matches the service name. e.g. `my-service` will have access to everything in Redis that is prefixed with `my-service`.

If your service does not require a session cache to be shared between instances or if you don't require Redis, you can
disable setting `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE=false` or changing the default value in `src/config/index.js`.

## Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. Services are automatically configured with the proxy environment variables when deployed.

Node.js 24 uses these variables to route outbound HTTP(S) requests through the proxy:

NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1
HTTPS_PROXY=...
NO_PROXY=...

No additional proxy configuration is required in the service.

## Local Development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Git hooks

Install git hooks (optional)

```bash
npm run git:hooks
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Formatting

#### Windows prettier issue

If you are having issues with formatting of line breaks on Windows update your global git config by running:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

## Docker

### Development image

> [!TIP]
> For Apple Silicon users, you may need to add `--platform linux/amd64` to the `docker run` command to ensure
> compatibility fEx: `docker build --platform=linux/arm64 --no-cache --tag trade-imports-fish-importer-fe`

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag trade-imports-fish-importer-fe:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 trade-imports-fish-importer-fe:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag trade-imports-fish-importer-fe .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 trade-imports-fish-importer-fe
```

### Publishing

The [Publish workflow](.github/workflows/publish.yml) automatically publishes stable releases on pushes to `main`,
including to public Docker Hub. Branch prereleases are published manually to ECR for deployment through the CDP Portal,
not to Docker Hub.

#### Publishing a prerelease

Use one of these branch formats:

- `feature/FISB-1234-upload-documents`
- `bugfix/FISB-1234-fix-upload`
- `ci/FISB-1234-build-image`
- `chore/FISB-1234-update-dependencies`

Ticket numbers can have any number of digits; descriptions must use lowercase letters and numbers separated by single hyphens.
Keep names short: Docker image tags have a 128-character limit, including version and run/attempt details.

In GitHub Actions, open **Publish**, select **Run workflow**, choose your branch and run it.
Branch pushes do not trigger the Publish workflow. After publishing succeeds, select the resulting version in the CDP Portal.

#### Understanding prerelease versions

For example:

```text
1.6.0-feature-fisb-1234-upload-documents-run-1658821493-attempt-1.0
```

CDP determines the base version (`1.6.0`). The suffix contains the full branch name, lowercased with `/` replaced by `-`,
so branches sharing a ticket remain distinguishable. `run` is the GitHub Actions run ID; each new workflow run gets a new ID.
`attempt` starts at `1` and increases on reruns of that same run.

Together, run and attempt prevent version reuse, including after rebases, when earlier tagged commits may no longer
be reachable. Each attempt has a unique suffix and starts a new prerelease sequence, so the final counter is always `.0`,
not an incrementing build number.

#### When publishing is blocked

These safeguards prevent CDP from reusing a stable ECR image tag:

- **Stable-tagged commit:** if the branch's latest commit carries a stable release tag (such as `1.6.0` or `v1.6.0`),
  add a new commit before publishing. Prerelease tags alone do not block publishing.
- **`#none` without an explicit bump:** commit messages, including bodies, since the latest reachable stable release
  must not contain `#none` unless that history also contains `#major`, `#minor` or `#patch`.
  Add an intentional bump token or remove `#none` from the unreleased history. Bump tokens also affect the eventual stable release.
  Earlier prerelease tags do not reset this check.

Unsupported branch names fail validation. These safeguards do not change publishing on `main`.

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Floci (replacing Localstack) for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A commented out backend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Dependabot

We have added an example dependabot configuration file to the repository. You can enable it by renaming
the [.github/example.dependabot.yml](.github/example.dependabot.yml) to `.github/dependabot.yml`

### SonarCloud

Instructions for setting up SonarCloud can be found in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties).
