## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd trade-imports-fish-inspection-fe
nvm use
```

## Server-side Caching

We use Catbox for server-side caching. By default the service will use CatboxRedis when deployed and CatboxMemory for
local development.
You can override the default behaviour by setting the `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE` environment variable to either `redis` or
`memory`.

Please note: CatboxMemory (`memory`) is _not_ suitable for production use! The cache will not be shared between each
instance of the service and it will not persist between restarts.

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory key-value store. Every instance of a service has access to the same Redis key-value store similar
to how services might have a database (or MongoDB). All frontend services are given access to a namespaced prefixed that
matches the service name. e.g. `my-service` will have access to everything in Redis that is prefixed with `my-service`.

If your service does not require a session cache to be shared between instances or if you don't require Redis, you can
disable setting `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE=false` or changing the default value in `src/config/index.js`.

## Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. Services are automatically configured with the proxy environment variables when deployed.

Node.js 24 uses these variables to route outbound HTTP(S) requests through the proxy:

NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1
HTTPS_PROXY=...
NO_PROXY=...

No additional proxy configuration is required in the service.

## Local Development

### Setup

Before making your first commit, follow the [Signed Commits](#signed-commits) setup.

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Signed Commits

Commits to this repository must be signed.

> 🔑 **We prefer signing commits with SSH keys.** This guide covers SSH only. GitHub also supports GPG; see
> [GPG alternative](#gpg-alternative) if you prefer to use it instead.

Steps 1 to 3 are required. Step 4 is optional.

#### 1. Prerequisites

- Git 2.34 or later is required for SSH signing. Check your version:

  ```bash
  git --version
  ```

- You already have an SSH key pair. Key creation is outside this guide;
  see [GitHub's SSH key generation documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
- Find the filename of your public key (it ends in `.pub`):

  ```bash
  ls ~/.ssh/*.pub
  ```

  The commands in this guide use `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` as an example. **If your key has a different name** (for example
  `~/.ssh/github_signing.pub`), replace `id_ed25519` with your key's name in every command. Otherwise you will get a
  `No such file or directory` error.

- Use a Bash-compatible terminal, such as Terminal on macOS/Linux or Git Bash on Windows.

#### 2. Configure Git to sign with SSH

These settings apply globally to all your repositories. Repository-local settings can override them.

```bash
git config --global gpg.format ssh
git config --global user.signingkey ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```

- `gpg.format ssh` selects SSH instead of GPG for signing.
- `user.signingkey` points to your SSH public key. The matching private key must be available to your SSH agent;
  if needed, load it into your running agent with `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`.
- `commit.gpgsign true` signs new commits automatically. The setting keeps its name even when signing with SSH.

Optionally, sign tags automatically too:

```bash
git config --global tag.gpgsign true
```

Check the email Git will use from inside this repository:

```bash
git config --get user.email
```

It must match a verified email on your GitHub account under **Settings > Emails**; otherwise commits can show as **Unverified**.
If necessary, set it for this repository, replacing the example with your verified email:

```bash
git config user.email "your-verified-email@example.com"
```

#### 3. Add your SSH key to GitHub as a signing key

1. Display your public key and copy the entire output:

   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

2. Go to **GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key**.
3. Give it a descriptive title, set **Key type** to **Signing Key**, paste the public key and select **Add SSH key**.
   Only ever share the `.pub` file; never paste your private key.

> ⚠️ **Important: authentication keys and signing keys are separate.**
>
> A key added as an **Authentication Key** (used for cloning, pushing and pulling) does **not** verify commits.
> If you use the same key for both, add it to GitHub twice: once with **Key type** set to **Authentication Key**
> and once with it set to **Signing Key**.

That's it: your commits will now be signed automatically.

#### Already working on a ticket branch?

Signing applies to new commits only; commits made before this setup stay unsigned. You don't need to switch branches.
To sign your latest commit as well, if it is your own and no one else is working from it, run:

```bash
git commit --amend --no-edit --only -S
```

This changes the commit ID. If you have already pushed that commit, coordinate with your team before updating the remote;
rewriting a shared branch can disrupt other people's work. For multiple earlier commits, agree with your team on how to
rewrite the branch history before proceeding.

#### 4. Optional: check your commits are signed

You don't need to do this. Use these checks if you want to confirm your setup or are troubleshooting.

**On GitHub:** push a commit, then open it on GitHub (in the branch's commit history or the pull request's **Commits**
tab) and confirm it shows **Verified**. Select the badge to see the signature details.

**Locally:** Git can't check SSH signatures on your machine until you set up an allowed signers file. Without it,
`git log --show-signature` reports a `gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` error. This only affects local checks; GitHub checks
signatures against the signing keys on your account. To set it up, run these once from inside this repository, so the
email matches your commits:

```bash
echo "$(git config --get user.email) $(cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub)" >> ~/.ssh/allowed_signers
git config --global gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile ~/.ssh/allowed_signers
git log --show-signature -1
```

The last command should show `Good "git" signature for <your-email>` for a signed commit. See Git's
[`gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-gpgsshallowedSignersFile)
for the file format.

#### GPG alternative

GitHub also supports signing with GPG. If you prefer GPG, skip the SSH-specific parts of this guide: the SSH key and
Git 2.34 requirements in step 1, the SSH commands in steps 2 and 3, and the local check in step 4. Instead, follow
GitHub's guides to [tell Git about your GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key#telling-git-about-your-gpg-key)
and [add it to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account).
The email check in step 2 still applies, and you can still check for **Verified** on GitHub. See
[About commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)
for how the options compare.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Commit shows Unverified:** check that the key is registered as a **Signing Key**, not just an **Authentication Key**,
  and that the commit email matches a verified email on your GitHub account. Inspect the commit's email with
  `git log -1 --format='%ae %ce'` (author and committer).
- **Commit fails with a signing or key error:** check that the `user.signingkey` path exists
  (`git config --get user.signingkey`) and that your key is loaded in the SSH agent (`ssh-add -l`; load it with
  `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
- **`gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile` error:** this only affects local checks such as `git log --show-signature`, not GitHub.
  See [step 4](#4-optional-check-your-commits-are-signed).
- **Older Git version:** [upgrade Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to 2.34 or later.
