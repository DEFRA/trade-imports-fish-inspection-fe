# Technical Documentation

Create or reconcile focused technical Markdown documents under `./docs`, with one file per part of the service (for example routes, server plugins, Nunjucks configuration, client assets, or local infrastructure) and an index that links them.

`./docs` is the input folder for MkDocs, so each document must be accurate Markdown that is compatible with MkDocs.

The implementation is the source of truth for current behavior.

When an existing document disagrees with working code, update the document to describe the code as it exists now; do not change code as part of this documentation task.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the subject and destination.** Translate the request into a specific feature, workflow, or part of the service. Search `./docs` (including subdirectories) for the closest existing document. Reuse and update that file when it covers the subject; otherwise choose a concise, descriptive Markdown filename under `./docs` for that part, following any local naming convention. If a request spans several parts, write a separate file for each part and link them rather than producing one large document. Do not add a subject to an existing file when it belongs to a different part of the service.
2. **Trace the behavior.** Locate the code that directly implements or controls the subject. Follow relevant route handlers, services, templates, configuration, environment variables, package scripts, and external calls as needed. Read nearby tests as corroborating evidence for expected inputs, outputs, and edge cases. Keep exploration scoped to claims the document needs to make.
3. **Compare documentation with evidence.** For an existing document, check each functional claim, code path, configuration name/default, command, and link against the current repository. Treat implementation and active configuration as authoritative for current behavior; use tests to confirm behavior, not to override contradictory implementation. Mark genuine uncertainties rather than filling gaps with assumptions.
4. **Create or revise the documents.** `./docs/index.md` should always exist independently of other documents, as it serves as the entry point for the documentation. If no suitable document exists, create one under `./docs` for that part of the service. If one exists, update it in place. Whenever a file is created, renamed, or removed, update the index `./docs/index.md` so it lists every part-specific document with a one-line description and no broken links. Create it only when the split documentation needs one, following the MkDocs conventions below. Explain the current behavior, relevant decisions, inputs/outputs, configuration, and operational steps only when they apply to the requested subject. Replace stale statements and examples, remove claims no longer supported by the code, and preserve accurate material. Keep the scope focused and avoid duplicating easy-to-find facts without a documentation benefit. Only document behaviour that is directly supported by code, configuration or nearby tests. Do not speculate or add unverified details.
5. **Verify the result.** Confirm the Markdown file is under `./docs`, its relative code links resolve, and any documented commands or configuration identifiers exist in the repository. Run `mkdocs build --strict -d <temp-dir>` from the repository root and confirm it builds without warnings or errors (for example broken links or missing nav targets). Write the output to a temporary directory outside `./docs` and delete it afterwards. Run a relevant documentation lint or check if the project provides one; otherwise perform a focused review of the edited file against the traced code. Report any behavior that could not be verified. Confirm that no code changes were made as part of this documentation update.

## MkDocs site conventions

- Documents under `./docs` are plain Markdown. Do not add front matter; no `title`, `description`, `layout`, or `order` keys are required. The page title comes from the first `#` heading, so start each document with one `#` heading.
- `mkdocs.yml` at the repository root configures the site. It has no `nav` section, so pages are discovered from `./docs`. Do not add a `nav` entry for a new page unless the user asks for one; `./docs/index.md` is the home page.
- Link between `./docs` pages using relative Markdown links to the `.md` file, for example `[Routes](routes.md)` or `[Routes](routes.md#route-table)`. MkDocs rewrites these to the built URLs, and `mkdocs build --strict` fails on links that do not resolve.
- Files outside `./docs` (for example `src/`, `compose/`, `package.json`) are not MkDocs input. Link to them with full repository URLs on the default branch, or show the path as plain code text.
- Use standard Markdown and fenced code blocks. Template syntax such as `{{` in code samples is not processed, so it needs no escaping.
- Use the Material theme's admonitions (`!!! note`, `!!! warning`) only if the site's Markdown extensions enable them in `mkdocs.yml`; otherwise use a plain bold label or blockquote.

## Evidence and writing rules

- Base behavioral statements on the narrowest code path that controls the behavior. Check callers and configuration when they change what that path does.
- Separate observed behavior from assumptions, intended behavior, and external-system behavior. Do not present an unverified external dependency response as guaranteed.
- Link to source, tests, and configuration with full repository URLs, since these files are outside the MkDocs input folder. Link to other `docs/` pages as described in the MkDocs conventions.
- Link to other `docs/` files for behavior owned by another part of the service instead of duplicating that description. Each fact should have one owning document.
- Use examples that match the current code and defaults. Check environment variable names, defaults, route paths, command names, and file locations literally.
- Follow any applicable repository-specific documentation instructions and nearby formatting conventions. When no convention exists, use descriptive headings and concise prose.
- Keep edits limited to the requested documentation and directly necessary documentation links. Leave implementation changes out of scope.

## Done when

- A suitable Markdown document exists under `./docs` for each affected part of the service and covers the requested subject.
- Every document is plain Markdown with a single top-level `#` title, and `mkdocs build --strict` builds without errors.
- The `./docs/index.md` index lists every part-specific document
- No document duplicates content owned by another.
- Each concrete claim about current functionality is supported by the implementation or clearly qualified where evidence is incomplete.
- Existing inaccurate claims and examples have been corrected to match current code.
- Relevant links and documented commands/configuration have been checked, and unresolved uncertainties are disclosed.
- The documentation accurately reflects the current behavior of the service, and any assumptions or external dependencies are clearly stated and qualified.
- No code changes have been made and the documentation solely reflects the current state of the service.
